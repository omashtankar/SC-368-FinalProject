            Misal Pav is a spicy, flavorful dish that is a staple in Maharashtra, and especially loved in Mumbai. It's a combination of a spicy lentil-based curry (misal) served with pav (bread rolls). The misal is made by cooking sprouts or beans in a rich, tangy, and spicy gravy, which is garnished with crispy sev, chopped onions, fresh coriander, and a squeeze of lime. This hearty dish is often enjoyed as a breakfast, brunch, or dinner, offering a perfect balance of protein, spice, and crunch.

            Misal Pav is traditionally enjoyed with pav, a soft, slightly sweet bread roll that complements the spicy misal. The misal is made from a variety of beans like moth beans (matki), which are sprouted to enhance their nutritional value. The curry is simmered with an array of spices such as red chili powder, garam masala, and tamarind, which give it its distinct heat and tanginess. The dish is a true reflection of the bold flavors that dominate Maharashtrian cuisine, with each bite offering a burst of spice, crunch, and freshness.

            Misal Pav has also become a popular street food, with vendors selling it across the streets of Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra. It is served with sides like yogurt, crunchy farsan (snacks), and additional chutneys, making it a filling and satisfying meal. Whether it's a quick breakfast to start the day or a hearty evening meal, Misal Pav brings comfort and excitement in every spoonful.

                <li>Simmer for 10-15 minutes until the curry thickens slightly and the flavors blend together.</li>
