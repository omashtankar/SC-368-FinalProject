            Poha is a classic Indian breakfast dish made from flattened rice, known for its light texture and savory flavor. This quick and easy dish is often enjoyed with a cup of tea and is a staple in many Indian households. Poha is versatile, easily customizable with various vegetables, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. In Maharashtra and Gujarat, it is typically eaten with a side of yogurt or a sprinkle of sev (crispy chickpea noodles), making it a complete, wholesome meal.

            The beauty of Poha lies in its simplicity. The flattened rice absorbs the spices and flavors from the tempering, creating a light yet satisfying dish. The addition of peanuts adds a crunch, while green chilies and mustard seeds give it a spicy kick. Often garnished with fresh coriander and a squeeze of lime, Poha offers a deliciously refreshing experience that can be enjoyed at any time of the day, not just for breakfast.

            In addition to being a delightful meal, Poha is considered a healthy option as it is low in fat and rich in iron, making it a good choice for a nutritious start to your day. It’s quick to prepare and perfect for busy mornings when you want a fulfilling, easy-to-make dish.

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <h4>Step 1: Prepare the Poha</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse the flattened rice (poha) in a colander under cold water. Gently shake to drain the excess water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes to soften.</li>
                <li>Fluff the poha with a fork to separate the grains after it has softened.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Step 2: Temper the Spices</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a pan or wok on medium heat. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.</li>
                <li>Add green chilies, ginger, and turmeric powder. Stir and sauté for about 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onion and sauté until it turns soft and translucent.</li>
                <li>Add the peanuts and sauté them for another 1-2 minutes until they’re slightly roasted.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Step 3: Cook the Poha</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the rinsed and drained poha to the pan and mix gently with the tempering.</li>
                <li>Add salt to taste and stir to combine all the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Cover the pan and let the poha cook for 2-3 minutes on low heat to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Step 4: Garnish and Serve</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove the poha from heat and fluff it again to separate the grains.</li>
                <li>Garnish with chopped fresh coriander leaves, a squeeze of lemon juice, and sev if desired.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with a side of yogurt or enjoy as is with a cup of tea.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Serving Suggestions</h3>
            <p>
                Poha is best served fresh and hot, making it a perfect breakfast or snack option. You can also enjoy it as a light meal for lunch or dinner. For an extra burst of flavor, serve it with a side of yogurt or curd, or top it with some crunchy sev for added texture. You can also adjust the level of spice by adding more or fewer green chilies according to your preference.
